## My process

I did not follow the directions exactly as planned, but I did start of creating a container and using flexbox to split the image and the description (containing the stats, stats headings, main paragraph, etc.) into flex-items. I somewhat attempted to make a grid with flexbox, so a flex-grid. I will need to go over positioning again because I had some difficulty. Overall, I put about 6+ hours of work into this (split over two-three days).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  background-color: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 25px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - This helped me for Flexbox although I may have overused Flexbox in this case!
